<p> Since I'm a great sister and human, I'm taking the time to put together this critically-acclaimed Sparknotes version of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. On a desert-like planet, a girl named Rey scavenges for junk with some pretty impressive acrobatic moves while she waits for her family that left her behind. Meanwhile, a soldier in the intimidating First Order defies the rules and saves a resistance pilot. This soldier dubs himself Finn. Unfortunately (fortunately), they crash land on the planet where we have just found Rey, the pilot is MIA so Finn sets off by himself in a cinematic shot eerily similar to The Martian.</p>

<p> Rey and Finn are then serendipitously united on th planet of junk with the new, hip R2-D2 named BB-8. After being chased through the small junk town by the First Order because of their little friend BB-8 who holds a sought-after map they manage to commandeer an old space ship named the Maltese Falcon which they fly in a naseauting scene off the planet. Once space-bound, they are hijacked  by familiar faces and embark on a journey to find Luke Skywalker. On the way, they take on the First Order and another surprising enemy. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll certainly wished this galaxy was a little bit closer. </p>
