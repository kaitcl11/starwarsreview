  <p> I'm sorry that you're not culturally with it, and I'm not home to take you to see this movie, so I'll be a generous older sister and let you know what people are saying about this Star Wars episode. The world realized that it needed more Star Wars to talk about, and Disney decided it needed a new ride for the theme park, so in tandem with JJ Abrams, Disney produced "The Force Awakens".

  <p> According to Rotten Tomatoes this a "certified fresh" movie with the average rating of 93%, which I'm sad to report, is higher than the Revenge of the Sith which featured the love of my life, Hayden Christensen. Word on the street is that this film will spark a new obsession with Star Wars amongst the post-2000 babies. It's balance of action, emotions, and throwbacks will make you want to see it twice, even if your wallet says no, just like it did to me. I suggest brushing up on the previous episodes, so the The familiar faces stand out even more to you and you remember their stories as if they were your own.  </p>
